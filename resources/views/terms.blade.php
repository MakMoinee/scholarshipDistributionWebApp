                                limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent

                            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision
                                will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the
                                greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue
                                in full force and effect.</p>
                            <h3>Waiver</h3>
                            <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of
                                an obligation under these Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such
                                right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a
                                breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
